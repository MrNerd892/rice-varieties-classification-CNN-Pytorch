# rice-varieties-classification-CNN-Pytorch
Using PyTorch, this code builds a CNN to classify rice images. It preprocesses the dataset, splits it into training, validation, and test sets, and trains the model over 5 epochs. The code evaluates the modelâ€™s accuracy, precision, and recall on the test set and saves the trained model.
